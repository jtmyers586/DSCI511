      "<meta content=\"&quot;What wine goes with Captain Crunch?&quot; -George Karlin Pairing wines and food is too often stressed about (and debated). True, in these days we no longer abide by rules like &quot;ONLY white with fish&quot; (ever had a coriander and coffee encrusted ahi with Syrah? Amazing!) but we are often confused about how to pair certain flavors and elements of a dish. The following are some guidelines for pairing a few common wines. Remember, pairing is a funny thing, because every dish will have more than just one component. You might try to pair a wine with chicken… but it's not JUST going to be chicken, is it? Of course not! It will have herbs or spices, a side dish of veggies, etc. There are many things to think about when pairing a dish, but in the end, you have to choose which part of the dish you want to emphasize and then match the wine to that element. Happy cooking and drinking! Sauvignon Blanc This crisp, lighter white wine is known for having a high level of acidity and a lot of citrus. It is a great wine to pair with dishes that are lighter yet still packed full of flavor, and the herbaceous qualities often found in the wine often bring out the herbs in a dish. Here are some foods/flavors that go exceptionally well with Sauvignon Blanc: Cheese/nuts: feta, goat cheese, pine nuts Meat/poultry: chicken, turkey, pork Seafood: fatty white fish, oysters, scallops, lobster, shrimp, sushi Fruits and Veggies: citrus, green apple, asparagus Herbs and Spices: chives, tarragon, cilantro Sauces: citrus and light cream sauces Desserts: sorbet, key lime pie, meringue, mango The most difficult thing about pairing Sauvignon Blanc? With this wine, I find that &quot;like&quot; does not always go with &quot;like&quot;: vinaigrette acidity kills the flavors of the wine and numbs the tart flavor in the vinaigrette. Chardonnay Chardonnay can be made into many styles, and this should always be kept in mind when pairing the wine with food. Are you drinking a full-bodied, California-style Chardonnay with a lot of oak and butter presence, or one that is lighter on the oak… or maybe not even aged in oak at all? Make sure you factor this in to your pairings. The best thing about Chardonnay? It's a decadent wine with sensual body, so it stands up against dishes and flavors when other white wines might fall flat. Despite its body, it still has great acidity, making it perfect for cutting the richness of cream dishes. Cheese/nuts: mild, semi-soft cheeses with unoaked Chardonnay; asiago, havarti, Stilton or other blue-veined cheeses with oaky Chardonnay; almonds and nearly any toasted nut Meat/poultry: veal, chicken, pork Seafood: halibut, shrimp, crab, lobster Fruits and Veggies: potato, apple, squash, mango Herbs and Spices: tarragon, sesame, basil Sauces: cream sauces, pesto Desserts: banana bread, vanilla pudding Top tip when pairing Chardonnay: make sure your wine doesn't overwhelm a dish with more subtle flavors. It is known to do so! Riesling Riesling might be one of the more misunderstood wines. In the U.S. it varies a lot in style, and many produce a very sweet Riesling that has almost become the &quot;norm&quot; for Riesling style in the U.S. Truth is, Rieslings from Europe are often very minimally sweet, and this wine's balance of acidity and sweetness actually makes it a very food-friendly option. The thing I love best about Riesling? It balances spice incredibly well, making it a perfect accompaniment to Thai food or other spicy dishes. Cheese/nust: Havarti, gouda, candied walnuts or pecans Meat/poultry: smoked sausage, duck, foie gras Seafood: sea bass, trout Fruits and Veggies: apricots, chili peppers, pears Herbs and Spices: rosemary, ginger, Thai or Indian spices Sauces: BBQ, spicy, chutney Desserts: apple pie, caramel sauce Pinot Noir Pinot Noir is a funny, funny grape that makes funny, funny wines. Only Pinot Noir can have fruits like cherry alongside descriptors like &quot;forest floor&quot; and &quot;mushroom&quot;. It is truly a beautiful juxtaposition of flavors and aromas. Although lighter in body, Pinot has some weight behind it and can stand up to some meat dishes. And don't be afraid to–gasp!–pair it with a heartier fish. I happen to love salmon and Pinot Noir, particularly if it is a winter dish with heartier accompaniments like mushrooms. Cheese/nuts: goat cheese, brie, walnuts Meat/poultry: lamb, sausage, filet mignon, chicken Seafood: ahi tuna, salmon Fruits and Veggies: mushrooms, dried fruits, figs, strawberries Herbs and Spices: truffle, nutmeg, cinnamon, clove Sauces: mushroom sauces, light-medium red sauces Desserts: creme brulee, white chocolate Syrah It is hard to pinpoint Syrah. As one of the world's more popular varietals, it is made throughout the globe and in many, many different styles. Although hard to generalize, overall, it's a big wine that often exudes pepper on the finish. It is great with herbs, and often has enough fruit to balance a bit of spice. Cheese/nuts: sharp cheddar, Roquefort/bleu-veined cheeses; hazelnuts, walnuts Meat/poultry: roasted game, pepperoni, spicy sausage, braised pork shoulder Seafood: ahi tuna, salmon Fruits and Veggies: currants, stewed tomatoes, beets Herbs and Spices: oregano, sage Sauces: BBQ, heavy red sauces Desserts: black forest cake, rhubarb pie, coffee-based desserts Avoid lighter dishes when drinking Syrah. No white fish, no oysters, no shrimp. No excuses. Merlot Merlot has fallen out of fashion over the last few years… but its sales numbers prove that although it might not be &quot;trendy&quot;, it is still being drunk. We often forget about this grape and the soft berry flavors and beautiful eucalyptus nose its wines often have. I love that you can find characteristics like mint and juniper in a Merlot and think its fun to play up these flavors and aromas by pairing it with a dish that contains the same elements. Cheese/nuts: Parmesan, Pecorino-Romano, chestnuts, walnuts Meat/poultry: grilled meats, steak Seafood: grilled meatier fish, ahi tuna Fruits and Veggies: caramelized onions, tomatoes, plums Herbs and Spices: mint, rosemary, juniper Sauces: bolognese, bearnaise Desserts: dark chocolate, berries, fondue Top tip: if drinking Merlot with chocolate, make SURE that the wine is sweeter than the chocolate. If not, the wine will taste sour. (Chocolate is tough to pair with!) Cabernet Sauvignon Cabernet is king in the U.S. and in many other parts of the world. We crave its bold tannins and fruit and it certainly pairs well with many of the dishes we as Americans love: including beef! But Cabernet Sauvignon has a softer side, and goes well with some cheeses and even lavender. Cheese/nuts: cheddar, gorgonzola, walnuts Meat/poultry: venison, rib eye, beef stew Seafood: grilled ahi tuna Fruits and Veggies: black cherries, tomatoes, broccoli Herbs and Spices: rosemary, juniper, lavender Sauces: brown sauce, tomato sauce Desserts: bittersweet chocolate I hope this aids you in pairing foods and wines! Above all, have FUN experimenting with all of these flavors!\" name=\"description\">\n",

      "<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>“What wine goes with Captain Crunch?” -George Karlin</em></p>\n",
      "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Pairing wines and food is too often stressed about (and debated). True, in these days we no longer abide by rules like “ONLY white with fish” (ever had a coriander and coffee encrusted ahi with Syrah? Amazing!) but we are often confused about how to pair certain flavors and elements of a dish. The following are some guidelines for pairing a few common wines.</p>\n",
      "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Remember, pairing is a funny thing, because every dish will have more than just one component. You might try to pair a wine with chicken… but it’s not JUST going to be chicken, is it? Of course not! It will have herbs or spices, a side dish of veggies, etc. There are many things to think about when pairing a dish, but in the end, you have to choose which part of the dish you want to emphasize and then match the wine to that element.</p>\n",
      "<p>Happy cooking and drinking!</p>\n",
      "<h2><strong>Sauvignon Blanc</strong></h2>\n",
      "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This crisp, lighter white wine is known for having a high level of acidity and a lot of citrus. It is a great wine to pair with dishes that are lighter yet still packed full of flavor, and the herbaceous qualities often found in the wine often bring out the herbs in a dish. Here are some foods/flavors that go exceptionally well with Sauvignon Blanc:</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Cheese/nuts:</strong> feta, goat cheese, pine nuts</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Meat/poultry:</strong> chicken, turkey, pork</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Seafood:</strong> fatty white fish, oysters, scallops, lobster, shrimp, sushi</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Fruits and Veggies:</strong> citrus, green apple, asparagus</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Herbs and Spices:</strong> chives, tarragon, cilantro</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Sauces:</strong> citrus and light cream sauces</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Desserts:</strong> sorbet, key lime pie, meringue, mango</p>\n",
      "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The most difficult thing about pairing Sauvignon Blanc? With this wine, I find that “like” does not always go with “like”: vinaigrette acidity kills the flavors of the wine and numbs the tart flavor in the vinaigrette.</p>\n",

      "<h2><strong>Chardonnay</strong></h2>\n",
      "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Chardonnay can be made into many styles, and this should always be kept in mind when pairing the wine with food. Are you drinking a full-bodied, California-style Chardonnay with a lot of oak and butter presence, or one that is lighter on the oak… or maybe not even aged in oak at all? Make sure you factor this in to your pairings.</p>\n",
      "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The best thing about Chardonnay? It’s a decadent wine with sensual body, so it stands up against dishes and flavors when other white wines might fall flat. Despite its body, it still has great acidity, making it perfect for cutting the richness of cream dishes.</p>\n",
      "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Cheese/nuts:</strong> mild, semi-soft cheeses with unoaked Chardonnay; asiago, havarti, Stilton or other blue-veined cheeses with oaky Chardonnay; almonds and nearly any<strong> toasted</strong> nut</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Meat/poultry:</strong> veal, chicken, pork</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Seafood:</strong> halibut, shrimp, crab, lobster</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Fruits and Veggies:</strong> potato, apple, squash, mango</p>\n",

The thing I love best about Riesling? It balances spice incredibly well, making it a perfect accompaniment to Thai food or other spicy dishes.</p>\n",

      "<h2><strong>Pinot Noir</strong></h2>\n",
      "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Pinot Noir is a funny, funny grape that makes funny, funny wines. Only Pinot Noir can have fruits like cherry alongside descriptors like “forest floor” and “mushroom”. It is truly a beautiful juxtaposition of flavors and aromas.</p>\n",
      "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Although lighter in body, Pinot has some weight behind it and can stand up to some meat dishes. And don’t be afraid to–gasp!–pair it with a heartier fish. I happen to love salmon and Pinot Noir, particularly if it is a winter dish with heartier accompaniments like mushrooms.</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Cheese/nuts:</strong> goat cheese, brie, walnuts</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Meat/poultry:</strong> lamb, sausage, filet mignon, chicken</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Seafood:</strong> ahi tuna, salmon</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Fruits and Veggies:</strong> mushrooms, dried fruits, figs, strawberries</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Herbs and Spices:</strong> truffle, nutmeg, cinnamon, clove</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Sauces:</strong> mushroom sauces, light-medium red sauces</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Desserts:</strong> creme brulee, white chocolate</p>\n",
      "<h2><strong>Syrah</strong></h2>\n",
      "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is hard to pinpoint Syrah. As one of the world’s more popular varietals, it is made throughout the globe and in many, many different styles. Although hard to generalize, overall, it’s a big wine that often exudes pepper on the finish. It is great with herbs, and often has enough fruit to balance a bit of spice.</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Cheese/nuts:</strong> sharp cheddar, Roquefort/bleu-veined cheeses; hazelnuts, walnuts</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Meat/poultry</strong>: roasted game, pepperoni, spicy sausage, braised pork shoulder</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Seafood:</strong> ahi tuna, salmon</p>\n",

      "<p><strong>Sauces:</strong> BBQ, heavy red sauces</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Desserts:</strong> black forest cake, rhubarb pie, coffee-based desserts</p>\n",
      "<p>Avoid lighter dishes when drinking Syrah. No white fish, no oysters, no shrimp. No excuses. <img alt=\":)\" src=\"../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\"/></p>\n",

      "<h2><strong>Merlot</strong></h2>\n",
      "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Merlot has fallen out of fashion over the last few years… but its sales numbers prove that although it might not be “trendy”, it is still being drunk. We often forget about this grape and the soft berry flavors and beautiful eucalyptus nose its wines often have. I love that you can find characteristics like mint and juniper in a Merlot and think its fun to play up these flavors and aromas by pairing it with a dish that contains the same elements.</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Cheese/nuts:</strong> Parmesan, Pecorino-Romano, chestnuts, walnuts</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Meat/poultry:</strong> grilled meats, steak</p>\n",

      "<p><strong>Herbs and Spices:</strong> mint, rosemary, juniper</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Sauces:</strong> bolognese, bearnaise</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Desserts:</strong> dark chocolate, berries, fondue</p>\n",
      "<p>Top tip: if drinking Merlot with chocolate, make SURE that the wine is sweeter than the chocolate. If not, the wine will taste sour. (Chocolate is tough to pair with!)</p>\n",
      "<h2><strong>Cabernet Sauvignon </strong></h2>\n",
      "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Cabernet is king in the U.S. and in many other parts of the world. We crave its bold tannins and fruit and it certainly pairs well with many of the dishes we as Americans love: including beef! But Cabernet Sauvignon has a softer side, and goes well with some cheeses and even lavender.</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Cheese/nuts:</strong> cheddar, gorgonzola, walnuts</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Meat/poultry:</strong> venison, rib eye, beef stew</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Seafood:</strong> grilled ahi tuna</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Fruits and Veggies:</strong> black cherries, tomatoes, broccoli</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Herbs and Spices:</strong> rosemary, juniper, lavender</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Sauces:</strong> brown sauce, tomato sauce</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Desserts:</strong> bittersweet chocolate</p>\n",

      "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Pairing wines and food is too often stressed about (and debated). True, in these days we no longer abide by rules like “ONLY white with fish” (ever had a coriander and coffee encrusted ahi with Syrah? Amazing!) but we are often confused about how to pair certain flavors and elements of a dish. The following are some guidelines for pairing a few common wines.</p>\n",
      "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Remember, pairing is a funny thing, because every dish will have more than just one component. You might try to pair a wine with chicken… but it’s not JUST going to be chicken, is it? Of course not! It will have herbs or spices, a side dish of veggies, etc. There are many things to think about when pairing a dish, but in the end, you have to choose which part of the dish you want to emphasize and then match the wine to that element.</p>\n",

It is a great wine to pair with dishes that are lighter yet still packed full of flavor, and the herbaceous qualities often found in the wine often bring out the herbs in a dish. Here are some foods/flavors that go exceptionally well with Sauvignon Blanc:</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Cheese/nuts:</strong> feta, goat cheese, pine nuts</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Meat/poultry:</strong> chicken, turkey, pork</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Seafood:</strong> fatty white fish, oysters, scallops, lobster, shrimp, sushi</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Fruits and Veggies:</strong> citrus, green apple, asparagus</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Herbs and Spices:</strong> chives, tarragon, cilantro</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Sauces:</strong> citrus and light cream sauces</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Desserts:</strong> sorbet, key lime pie, meringue, mango</p>\n",
      "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The most difficult thing about pairing Sauvignon Blanc? With this wine, I find that “like” does not always go with “like”: vinaigrette acidity kills the flavors of the wine and numbs the tart flavor in the vinaigrette.</p>\n",

      "<h2><strong>Chardonnay</strong></h2>\n",
      "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Chardonnay can be made into many styles, and this should always be kept in mind when pairing the wine with food. Are you drinking a full-bodied, California-style Chardonnay with a lot of oak and butter presence, or one that is lighter on the oak… or maybe not even aged in oak at all? Make sure you factor this in to your pairings.</p>\n",
      "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The best thing about Chardonnay? It’s a decadent wine with sensual body, so it stands up against dishes and flavors when other white wines might fall flat. Despite its body, it still has great acidity, making it perfect for cutting the richness of cream dishes.</p>\n",
      "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Cheese/nuts:</strong> mild, semi-soft cheeses with unoaked Chardonnay; asiago, havarti, Stilton or other blue-veined cheeses with oaky Chardonnay; almonds and nearly any<strong> toasted</strong> nut</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Meat/poultry:</strong> veal, chicken, pork</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Seafood:</strong> halibut, shrimp, crab, lobster</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Fruits and Veggies:</strong> potato, apple, squash, mango</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Herbs and Spices:</strong> tarragon, sesame, basil</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Sauces:</strong> cream sauces, pesto</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Desserts:</strong> banana bread, vanilla pudding</p>\n",
      "<p>Top tip when pairing Chardonnay: make sure your wine doesn’t overwhelm a dish with more subtle flavors. It is known to do so!</p>\n",
      "<h2><strong>Riesling</strong></h2>\n",
      "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Riesling might be one of the more misunderstood wines. In the U.S. it varies a lot in style, and many produce a very sweet Riesling that has almost become the “norm” for Riesling style in the U.S. Truth is, Rieslings from Europe are often very minimally sweet, and this wine’s balance of acidity and sweetness actually makes it a very food-friendly option. The thing I love best about Riesling? It balances spice incredibly well, making it a perfect accompaniment to Thai food or other spicy dishes.</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Cheese/nust:</strong> Havarti, gouda, candied walnuts or pecans</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Meat/poultry:</strong> smoked sausage, duck, foie gras</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Seafood:</strong> sea bass, trout</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Fruits and Veggies:</strong> apricots, chili peppers, pears</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Herbs and Spices:</strong> rosemary, ginger, Thai or Indian spices</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Sauces:</strong> BBQ, spicy, chutney</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Desserts:</strong> apple pie, caramel sauce</p>\n",

Beautiful photo by Jim Fischer. https://www.flickr.com/photos/jimfischer/9521621632</p></div>\n",
      "<h2><strong>Pinot Noir</strong></h2>\n",
      "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Pinot Noir is a funny, funny grape that makes funny, funny wines. Only Pinot Noir can have fruits like cherry alongside descriptors like “forest floor” and “mushroom”. It is truly a beautiful juxtaposition of flavors and aromas.</p>\n",
      "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Although lighter in body, Pinot has some weight behind it and can stand up to some meat dishes. And don’t be afraid to–gasp!–pair it with a heartier fish. I happen to love salmon and Pinot Noir, particularly if it is a winter dish with heartier accompaniments like mushrooms.</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Cheese/nuts:</strong> goat cheese, brie, walnuts</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Meat/poultry:</strong> lamb, sausage, filet mignon, chicken</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Seafood:</strong> ahi tuna, salmon</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Fruits and Veggies:</strong> mushrooms, dried fruits, figs, strawberries</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Herbs and Spices:</strong> truffle, nutmeg, cinnamon, clove</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Sauces:</strong> mushroom sauces, light-medium red sauces</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Desserts:</strong> creme brulee, white chocolate</p>\n",
      "<h2><strong>Syrah</strong></h2>\n",
      "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is hard to pinpoint Syrah. As one of the world’s more popular varietals, it is made throughout the globe and in many, many different styles. Although hard to generalize, overall, it’s a big wine that often exudes pepper on the finish. It is great with herbs, and often has enough fruit to balance a bit of spice.</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Cheese/nuts:</strong> sharp cheddar, Roquefort/bleu-veined cheeses; hazelnuts, walnuts</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Meat/poultry</strong>: roasted game, pepperoni, spicy sausage, braised pork shoulder</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Seafood:</strong> ahi tuna, salmon</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Fruits and Veggies:</strong> currants, stewed tomatoes, beets</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Herbs and Spices:</strong> oregano, sage</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Sauces:</strong> BBQ, heavy red sauces</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Desserts:</strong> black forest cake, rhubarb pie, coffee-based desserts</p>\n",
      "<p>Avoid lighter dishes when drinking Syrah. No white fish, no oysters, no shrimp. No excuses. <img alt=\":)\" src=\"../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\"/></p>\n",
      "<p><img alt=\"food-and-wine-pairings\" class=\"size-full wp-image-8488\" height=\"426\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" src=\"http://sedimentality.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/red-wine-1433498_640.jpg\" srcset=\"http://sedimentality.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/red-wine-1433498_640.jpg 640w, http://sedimentality.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/red-wine-1433498_640-300x200.jpg 300w\" width=\"640\"/></p>\n",
      "<h2><strong>Merlot</strong></h2>\n",
      "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Merlot has fallen out of fashion over the last few years… but its sales numbers prove that although it might not be “trendy”, it is still being drunk. We often forget about this grape and the soft berry flavors and beautiful eucalyptus nose its wines often have. I love that you can find characteristics like mint and juniper in a Merlot and think its fun to play up these flavors and aromas by pairing it with a dish that contains the same elements.</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Cheese/nuts:</strong> Parmesan, Pecorino-Romano, chestnuts, walnuts</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Meat/poultry:</strong> grilled meats, steak</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Seafood:</strong> grilled meatier fish, ahi tuna</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Fruits and Veggies:</strong> caramelized onions, tomatoes, plums</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Herbs and Spices:</strong> mint, rosemary, juniper</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Sauces:</strong> bolognese, bearnaise</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Desserts:</strong> dark chocolate, berries, fondue</p>\n",
      "<p>Top tip: if drinking Merlot with chocolate, make SURE that the wine is sweeter than the chocolate. If not, the wine will taste sour. (Chocolate is tough to pair with!)</p>\n",
      "<h2><strong>Cabernet Sauvignon </strong></h2>\n",
      "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Cabernet is king in the U.S. and in many other parts of the world. We crave its bold tannins and fruit and it certainly pairs well with many of the dishes we as Americans love: including beef! But Cabernet Sauvignon has a softer side, and goes well with some cheeses and even lavender.</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Cheese/nuts:</strong> cheddar, gorgonzola, walnuts</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Meat/poultry:</strong> venison, rib eye, beef stew</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Seafood:</strong> grilled ahi tuna</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Fruits and Veggies:</strong> black cherries, tomatoes, broccoli</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Herbs and Spices:</strong> rosemary, juniper, lavender</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Sauces:</strong> brown sauce, tomato sauce</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Desserts:</strong> bittersweet chocolate</p>\n",
      "<p>I hope this aids you in pairing foods and wines!
